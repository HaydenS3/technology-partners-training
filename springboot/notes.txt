Issues:
    Sending JSON Post Request
        Error: Required request parameter 'recipe' for method parameter type Recipe is not present
            Tried:
                curl -X POST localhost:8081/recipe/add -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Beef Stew","prepTimeMinutes":20,"cookTimeMinutes":60,"servings":4}'
                curl -X POST localhost:8081/recipe/add -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d recipe='{"name":"Beef Stew","prepTimeMinutes":20,"cookTimeMinutes":60,"servings":4}'
                curl -X POST localhost:8081/recipe/add -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d 'recipe={"name":"Beef Stew","prepTimeMinutes":20,"cookTimeMinutes":60,"servings":4}'
                curl -X POST localhost:8081/recipe/add -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"recipe":{"name":"Beef Stew","prepTimeMinutes":20,"cookTimeMinutes":60,"servings":4}}'
            Fixed: Noticed that I was using @RequestParam instead of @RequestBody
        New Error: It's basically upset I haven't given it an id
            Turns out this error is happening on both RecipeController and IngredientController, not sure what I did to break IngredientController
            Tried:
                Removing many to many stuff
                Removing id getters and setters
            Going to look over old commits to see what might have changed, since this was working before
            There was a typo in my Ingredient table name, FIXED
            The new method in RecipeController is still broken
            Commenting out the save function works to fix the error, for some reason an id is not being generated using this method
            copyProperties must be overwriting the id then? This is not the case
            The same issue happens when using the non-JSON method
            The source of the issue is that I added @Column(name = "recipe_id") earlier for ids and now it is expecting both an "id" and "recipe_id", hopefully I can just manually remove the id column via cli
            SOLVED!
            

    Many To Many Mapping
        Warning: 
            GenerationTarget encountered exception accepting command : Error executing DDL "alter table recipe_ingredient add constraint FKgu1oxq7mbcgkx5dah6o8geirh foreign key (recipe_id) references recipe (recipe_id)" via JDBC Statement
            Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Failed to add the foreign key constraint. Missing index for constraint 'FKgu1oxq7mbcgkx5dah6o8geirh' in the referenced table 'recipe'
        Fixing the above issue solved this warning :)
        Need to figure out how to add to joint table via PostMapping
        Figured it out
